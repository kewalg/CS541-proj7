Assignment 7 - CaloriesTracker

In this assignment, I have made an app that helps user track his/her calorie intake. The main purpose of this app is to add the food they consume and the calories it has. It then shows how many calories have been consumed so far and stuff. For storing the data i have used SQLite. Also the dates on which the food has been consumed is added.

Following is the summary of the app development:

Day 1: Basic UI implemented

Day 2: Added the class food file under model for database, added database contents and helper

Day 3: Added the listviewadapter for custom listview to maintain the food items.

Day 4: Custom viewholder and other methods

Day 5: Create table function and adding a new table on upgrade

Day 6: Added cursor to traverse through database, total calories count, delete food item and getting/retriving all food items added to the DB

Day 7: Adding food items to the database, showing added data into the listview, fetching data from DB, adding a holder for freezing data to be accessed later.

Day 8: Final Commits/UI changes.
